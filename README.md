# Messenger

A one-to-one realtime chat app.

## Initial Setup

Create the PostgreSQL database (these instructions may need to be adapted for your operating system):

```
psql
CREATE DATABASE messenger;
\q
```

Update db.js to connect with your local PostgreSQL set up. The [Sequelize documentation](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) can help with this.

Create a .env file in the server directory and add your session secret (this can be any string):

```
SESSION_SECRET = "your session secret"
```

In the server folder, install dependencies and then seed the database:

```
cd server
npm install
npm run seed
```

In the client folder, install dependencies:

```
cd client
npm install
```

### Running the Application Locally

In one terminal, start the front end:

```
cd client
npm start
```

In a separate terminal, start the back end:

```
cd server
npm run dev
```

## Development Stack

This app is built using React and Material UI on the front end, Node.js on the back end with PostgreSQL and Sequelize, and Socket.io is used for real time communication.
